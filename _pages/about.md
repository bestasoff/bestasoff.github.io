As a Machine Learning Engineer with about 1.5 years of experience in the field, I have worked on various projects in domains such as Computer Vision and NLP.

I am passionate about using Machine Learning to improve our world and am constantly seeking to learn more and stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the field.

On summer 2022, I've graduated with Bachelor's degree from the Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science of [Belarusian State University](https://bsu.by/) and with Master's level degree diploma from Machine Learning Developer academic program of [Yandex School of Data Analysis](https://academy.yandex.com/dataschool/).

Currently, I'm working as a Computer Vision Engineer in [Gradient](https://gradient.photo/).
